# Party-Exploring-IOS-App

When initialize the App, it will automatically creates 3 random events from the events array. Each event will be showing their name, image, price, start date, and end date. 

In the past, I only tried created a interface using Storyboard, it took me a while to get to know how to use SwiftUI. And within 2 hours, I cannot finish the filter page.

Thank you for the assesment.
